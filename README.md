# Ctrl-Q
This **Fabric** mod forces CTRL-Q for dropping a stack of items (Helpful for macos users)

(Basically, it forces the "ctrl" key to be used when dropping a stack of item instead of "cmd" on MacOS)

PS: The mod was made and tested in 1.16.4 and 1.16.5. I think there'll be an error if you go under these versions, so don't do it.
(This mod is open source, so do whatever you want with it!)
